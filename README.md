## About the Project:

Independent of any media or organizational influence, and solely motivated by my religious and personal beliefs, I embarked on creating this app. My hope is to earn the satisfaction of the Almighty, as that is my only aspiration.

"O Lord, bring our endeavors to a good end, for You know the secrets hidden in our hearts and are aware of all our intentions."
